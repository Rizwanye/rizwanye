### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rizwan Ye, I have an Honours degree in computing science, and majored in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the University Of Technology Sydney. 
Tn my honours degree I primarily focused on researching Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and visual explainable artificial intelligence (VXAI), for the non-tech people out there, this research basically revolves around how we can make complex AI programs more understandable.
