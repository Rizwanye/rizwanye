# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rizwan Ye.
I have an Honours degree in computing science, and Majored in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics** from the University Of Technology Sydney. 

In my honours degree I primarily focused on researching **Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)** and **visual explainable artificial intelligence (VXAI)**, for the non-tech people out there, this research basically revolves around how we can make complex AI programs more understandable.

Skills: Python Programming / Data Analytics / Visual Analytics / Machine Learning / Object Detection / Image classification

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on XAI and VAI with my supervisor 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning XAI 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Within 3 years I have used over 10 different laptops
